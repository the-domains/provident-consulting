6 Questions to Ponder Before Starting A Nonprofit

With the advent of social entrepreneurism, many are raising the question if there are too many nonprofits. Limited charitable dollars is the main reason. The more charities that exist, the smaller the slice for each.

Why is this question never asked of for-profits? No one ever wonders if the economy will support another McDonald's franchise or another internet business. 

Perhaps the question should not be are there too many nonprofits, but where are all the good nonprofits? Where's the impact? (I can just hear that old Wendy's commercial now.....picture the old lady screaming "Where's the beef?!") 

The truth is that many nonprofits get started with great intentions, but often hidden agendas derail impact. I've encountered countless examples of people who are fed up with their current jobs (or have lost their job) and decide that starting a nonprofit would be a great way to be their own boss and get paid to make a difference. Others start their own organizations that duplicate the efforts of others just so they don't have to answer to someone else. Notoriety can also derail good intentions. Being in the public eye and getting pats on the back can cause well-meaning charity leaders to be less than transparent about operations or financial struggles.

The truth is the same supply and demand rules exist for charities as coffee shops. But, nonprofits must provide value in the form of impact while competing against iTunes, Old Navy, and even Wendy's for consumers' discretionary dollars.

So, while starting a nonprofit is not for the faint of heart (or those looking for an easy win), it is a noble pursuit for those who want to make a difference. 

Before you decide to start a nonprofit ask yourself these questions:

1. Is the need large enough to fill?
2. Do I offer a unique solution?
3. Does my location provide enough charitable dollars and volunteers?
4. Would partnering with a complementary organization provide me with sufficient resources to meet this need?
5. Do I have the expertise and time to commit?
6. Am I comfortable with turning over "ownership" to the community?

In the end, our world needs social entrepreneurs to step up and step in to solve the word's problems with big hearts and smart innovations. Digging in to know your real Why will not only keep you focused but will keep you going when times get tough.

What is your reason for wanting to start a nonprofit?
